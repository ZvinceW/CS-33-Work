_____________
|%rsp   | x |
|%rsp+8 | y |
|%rsp+16| &z|
|%rsp+24| z |
 ... 

B.
Eval passed x, y, &z, z, and an address to location %rsp+64 into process.

C.
The values x, y, z, and &z were all stored in the stack frame. Therefore, process can access those four values from the stack frame. Process can also access the address to %rsp+64 from the register %rdi.

D.
The code for process uses the address to %rsp+64 passed in by eval to place the member variables of r at that location with the variables' corresponding offsets. It wrote to %rsp+64 to set r.u[0]. It wrote to %rsp+72 to set r.u[1]. It wrote to %rsp+80 to set r.q.

F.
When a structure is passed as a function argument, its values are stored in the stack frame. When the structure is returned as function results, its values are copied from the stack frame to the register %rax with each value's corresponding offsets.
